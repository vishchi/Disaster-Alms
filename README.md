# Disaster-Alms
This is a Web Development Project based on HTML, PHP,  CSS on the frontend, and MySQL on the backend. It was done by a team of 3 during Hackathon held in our college in 2019. The sole idea behind this system is that it is a central money repository. People can donate into this fund. Whenever any natural calamity occurs around the nation, an estimate is formed and accordingly, the funds are transferred to the respective people. There is also a victim section wherein a victim can request for money and upon verifying the genuinity, a small amount is transferred immediately.
